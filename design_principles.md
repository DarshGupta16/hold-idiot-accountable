# HIA — UI/UX Design Principles & Visual Guidelines

> **Core intent**: Calm truth, zero drama. The interface should feel like a quiet ledger of reality — not a dashboard, not a control panel, not a productivity toy.

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Emotional posture
- Neutral, observant, non-judgmental
- Never celebratory, never alarmist
- The app *reports*, it does not *react*

The UI should feel closer to a **medical chart** or **flight status board** than a productivity app.

---

### 1.2 Cognitive load budget
- One primary fact per screen
- Optional depth must always be *collapsed by default*
- No screen should require interpretation

If something needs explanation, it does not belong on the Home screen.

---

### 1.3 Absence of gamification
Explicitly avoid:
- Streaks
- Scores
- Progress bars
- Confetti / rewards
- Motivational copy

This is accountability, not encouragement.

---

## 2. Visual Hierarchy Rules

### 2.1 Primary → Secondary → Tertiary
Every screen must clearly communicate:
1. **Primary state** (binary, immediate)
2. **Secondary context** (supporting detail)
3. **Tertiary depth** (only on intent)

Never allow tertiary information to compete visually with primary state.

---

### 2.2 Information density
- Prefer **white space** over borders
- Prefer **alignment** over separators
- Prefer **typographic contrast** over color contrast

If a divider line feels necessary, first try spacing.

---

## 3. Color System

### 3.1 Palette philosophy
- Low saturation
- Neutral first
- Color used *only* for semantic meaning

Color should feel like a **whisper**, not a signal flare.

---

### 3.2 Core colors (conceptual)
- Background: off-white / near-black (depending on mode)
- Text primary: near-black / near-white
- Text secondary: softened gray

Semantic accents (very restrained):
- Neutral state: muted gray
- Warning: desaturated amber
- Breach: desaturated red

No pure black. No pure white. No neon.

---

### 3.3 Color usage rules
- Never use color alone to convey meaning
- Never color large surfaces for alerts
- Icons may change color; backgrounds should not

If something is important, make it *clear*, not *loud*.

---

## 4. Typography

### 4.1 Typeface philosophy
Typography should feel:
- Modern
- Serious
- Calm
- Slightly academic

Avoid playful, rounded, or overly geometric fonts.

---

### 4.2 Font pairing
- **Primary font**: clean sans-serif with strong readability
- **Optional accent font**: subtle serif or humanist sans-serif (sparingly)

Use accent fonts *only* for headings or emphasis — never body text.

---

### 4.3 Typographic hierarchy
- Headline: large, restrained, minimal wording
- Subheadline: smaller, softer color
- Body: compact line-height, high readability
- Metadata: small, quiet, visually recessed

Avoid ALL CAPS except for very small labels.

---

### 4.4 Line length & spacing
- Ideal line length: 50–70 characters
- Generous vertical spacing
- Tight horizontal alignment

Reading should feel effortless and unhurried.

---

## 5. Layout & Spacing

### 5.1 Grid discipline
- Simple vertical flow
- Few columns
- Predictable alignment

The layout should feel *inevitable*.

---

### 5.2 Padding philosophy
- Prefer fewer components with more space
- Avoid dense clusters

If two elements feel related, group them by proximity, not borders.

---

## 6. Components

### 6.1 Cards
- Soft edges
- Subtle shadow or none at all
- Cards should feel like paper, not glass

Avoid stacking many cards on one screen.

---

### 6.2 Buttons
- Rare
- Neutral
- Text-based where possible

Buttons should never demand attention.

---

### 6.3 Expandable sections
- Always collapsed by default
- Clear affordance (caret, label)
- Smooth, quick expansion

Expansion is an *invitation*, not a requirement.

---

## 7. Motion & Transitions

### 7.1 Motion philosophy
- Motion exists only to preserve continuity
- Never decorative

If removing motion improves clarity, remove it.

---

### 7.2 Animation rules
- Short durations
- No bounce
- No overshoot

Truth should not wobble.

---

## 8. Copy & Language

### 8.1 Tone
- Neutral
- Precise
- Factual

Avoid:
- Moral language
- Emotional framing
- Motivational phrases

---

### 8.2 Examples
Good:
- "Studying"
- "Session ended early"
- "System anomaly detected"

Bad:
- "Stay focused!"
- "Uh oh!"
- "You got distracted"

The app does not scold.

---

## 9. Accessibility & Comfort

- High contrast text
- Large tap targets
- No reliance on color alone
- Dark mode parity (not inversion)

Comfort is part of trust.

---

## 10. What HIA Must Never Feel Like

- A social app
- A productivity game
- A monitoring console
- A motivational coach
- A punishment system

It is a **truth surface**, nothing more.

---

## Final North Star

> *If someone opens HIA after a long day, it should feel like quietly checking the time — not like being evaluated.*

If a design choice violates this feeling, it is wrong.
